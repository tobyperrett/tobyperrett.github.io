Hi! I'm a senior postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bristol, working with [Professor Dima Damen](https://dimadamen.github.io/), and co-advising [Chiara Plizzari](https://chiaraplizz.github.io/) and [Saptarshi Sinha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saptarshi-sinha-ab42a410b/). I'm a founding member of the team collecting the [EPIC Kitchens](https://epic-kitchens.github.io) datasets, and am also working on the [Visual AI](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/projects/visualai/index.html) project led by [Professor Andrew Zisserman](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/). 

My research is on video understanding, particularly from egocentric cameras. I'm interested in improving models and representations when labelled data is [scarse](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Perrett_Temporal-Relational_CrossTransformers_for_Few-Shot_Action_Recognition_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf) or [imbalanced](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Perrett_Use_Your_Head_Improving_Long-Tail_Video_Recognition_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf), and exploring how to [generalise](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Plizzari_What_Can_a_Cook_in_Italy_Teach_a_Mechanic_in_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf) to unseen domains. I'm currently looking at how we can exploit 3D and long-term temporal knowledge to improve reasoning in these situations.


<!-- I'm interested in making video understanding systems work with realistic data which is less-than-perfect. This affects the whole training pipeline, from the collection and annotation stages, to training models to generalise to new domains and when data is few-shot or unbalanced. I have recently become interested in long-term video understanding. -->


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
