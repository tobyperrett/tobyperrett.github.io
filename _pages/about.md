Hi! I'm a postdoc at the University of Bristol, working with [Professor Dima Damen](https://dimadamen.github.io/), and co-advising [Chiara Plizzari](https://chiaraplizz.github.io/) and [Saptarshi Sinha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saptarshi-sinha-ab42a410b/). I'm also working on the [Visual AI](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/projects/visualai/index.html) project led by [Professor Andrew Zisserman](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/). 

I'm interested in making video understanding systems work with realistic data which is less-than-perfect. This affects the whole training pipeline, from the collection and annotation stages, to training models to generalise to new domains and when data is few-shot or unbalanced. I have recently become interested in long-term video understanding.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
